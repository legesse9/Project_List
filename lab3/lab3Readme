Describe how you used gdb to find a bug in your problem while debigging or if you had no bugs, how
you used gdb to verify that your program was working correctley?: I did not have any bugs in my 
program so I used gdb to verify my code. I set breakpoints at main, get_ingredients, and get_thispizza
I then ran the gdb and printed the variables "ingredients" and "thispizza" and their elements in
their respective arrays. I stepped through the entire program and everything printed correctly.
